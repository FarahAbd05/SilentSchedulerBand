# Silent Scheduler Band

The **Silent Scheduler Band** is a wearable task reminder system designed to assist individuals with disabilities, particularly those who are deaf, hard of hearing, neurodivergent, or experience memory or attention challenges.

Instead of using sound-based alerts, this device delivers **multisensory cues** through:

* Text reminders on an LCD display
* Color-coded RGB LED alerts
* Vibration motor for tactile feedback

## Purpose

This project was created for the **IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society Arduino Contest 2025**, themed:

> **"Assisting People with a Disability"**

It aims to showcase how accessible embedded systems can empower independence and routine management without relying on sound, especially in environments where silence is essential or users may not hear alerts.

## Built With

* Arduino UNO R3 (RexQualis)
* DS3231 RTC Module
* 16x2 LCD Display
* 10kΩ Potentiometer
* RGB LED + 220Ω Resistors
* L293D Motor Driver
* 3–6V DC Vibration Motor
* Push Button + 10kΩ Resistor
* Power Supply Module
* Breadboard + Jumper Wires

## Features

* Hardcoded daily task schedule
* Multisensory feedback: LED color + vibration + LCD
* Manual dismissal with push button
* Real-time clock accuracy with RTC module

## Future Improvements

* Let users input their own tasks via buttons or Bluetooth
* Miniaturize into a wristband or wearable form
* Rechargeable battery power instead of breadboard prototype
